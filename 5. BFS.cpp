-----------------------------------Algorithm-------------------------------
1)Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
2)Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
3)Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't 
    in the visited list to the back of the queue.
4)Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.

----------Complexity-------------
Time Complexity: O(V + E)  
Auxiliary Space: O(V) 

Each of the V vertices is visited once, and all E edges are explored exactly once during traversal. 
So, the total time is proportional to the number of vertices plus edges. We use a visited array, a 
queue, and a result list â€” all of which store up to V elements in the worst case, giving total 
auxiliary space of O(V).
