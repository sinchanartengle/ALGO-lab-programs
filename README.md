 ALGO Lab Programs

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in C++ for the Algorithm Laboratory course.  
Each program solves a classic algorithmic problem and can be compiled and run independently.

 Programs Included
1. Knapsack (0/1)
2. Knapsack (Fractional)
3. Prim’s Algorithm
4. Kruskal’s Algorithm
5. BFS
6. DFS
7. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
8. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
9. Travelling Salesman Problem
10. Multistage Graph
11. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
12. Transitive Closure
13. N-Queens Problem
14. Subset Sum Problem


 Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Git (for cloning repository)
- VS Code (optional, but recommended for editing and running)
